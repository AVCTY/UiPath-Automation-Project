# UiPath-Automation-Project
Project to explore and automate processes using UiPath. This demo project was made to explore UiPath and RPA. The goal of this project is to automate the retrieval of current price data for selected products from an e-commerce website called FootLocker. The data retrieved can then be used for purposes such as: competitor price analysis, cost effective pricing strategies, determining optimal product price, etc.

## Setup
The "Project" folder is where the input and output of the process automation is stored.

The "UiPathArthur" folder is where the main project is stored.

To use and test the project, clone the repo or download the files and change the path directories in the project to fit the path directories on your machine.
